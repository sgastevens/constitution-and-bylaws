Any passed piece of legislation shall be referred to by its respective type: resolution or proclamation.

        \item A three-digit ordinal number, incrementing for each bill presented to the Secretary; this number shall be prefixed with zeros to the meet three-digit requirement when necessary — i.e. “005” for the fifth bill introduced into the Senate;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The phrase “of the”, followed by the current Senate session number, followed by “Senate of the Student Government Association of Stevens Institute of Technology”;

\paragraph{Officer Terms}
Officers of an RSO will serve a term of one-year or until the next
Unified Elections, and until their successor is elected, or a lesser
term if specified in the RSO’s Constitution. Officers of an RSO will
take office immediately following their election, unless otherwise
specified in the RSO’s Constitution.

\paragraph{Timeline}
Unified Elections shall occur once every academic year. The first full
week of school following the University-defined Spring Recess shall be
the Unified Elections period. The last week of school preceding Spring
Recess shall be the Unified Nominations period. An RSO must accept
officer nominations during the Unified Nominations period, submit all
nominations to the Office of Student Life immediately thereafter, and
then hold a special meeting for elections of all officers during the
Unified Elections period, in which any ballot cast for an individual
whose nomination was not previously approved by the Office of Student
Life will be considered invalid.

\paragraph{Custom Elections}
An RSO may define in their Constitution a custom period for their
Unified Elections, provided there is at least one week in between the
Unified Nominations period and the Unified Elections period, and that
the elections process complies with all other rules specified in these
bylaws, especially above.

\paragraph{Changes}
Any changes in an RSO’s officers outside of the standard Unified
Elections period (including RSOs that conduct Unified Elections during
a custom time period) may only occur after notification of the Vice President of Student Interests and after verification by the Office of Student Life of any individuals intending to become an officer.

an RSO officer position occurs, a special election process shall be
held following the same procedures as Unified Elections, except that
the Unified Nominations period will begin the first full week of class

The voting membership of the general body of an RSO shall have the right to vote on all items not left solely to the discretion of its executive board.

\section{Overruling of Quorum or Voting Membership}
Should an RSO become unable to conduct business due to its inability to achieve quorum or the necessary amount of eligible voting members at any of its meetings as a result of an ineffective definition of quorum or voting membership in its constitution or bylaws, the RSO’s quorum or definition of voting membership may be temporarily overruled by the Vice President of Student Interests. The Vice President of Student Interests shall mandate a more suitable, temporary definition of quorum or voting membership for the RSO that allows for business to be conducted at its meetings. This temporary definition of quorum or voting membership shall only last until the RSO has voted on the business it initially sought to conduct, amended its definition of quorum or voting membership in its constitution or bylaws to be more suitable, and had any changes to its constitution reviewed by the Constitution and Bylaws Committee and approved by the Senate. This process shall not occur unless the RSO submits evidence to the Vice President of Student Interests of having held at least one special meeting designated solely for the purpose of conducting business and having notified the entirety of its voting membership of this meeting at least one week prior.

Five percent of the student activity fees of each class year, as defined by 
the Constitution of the SGA, shall be set aside into senior year activities 
accounts bound to the graduating class from which the fees were collected. 
This account shall be unavailable for expenditure until the class year to 
which it is bound enters its senior year. The Senior Year Activity Committee, 
by a vote of two-thirds of committee quorum, shall have the power to spend 
from the account once the account's bound year enters its senior year. 

\section{Advertising}
The SGA shall be responsible for informing the Student Body of all campus 
initiatives and for assisting all RSOs in publicizing their events. 

The SGA shall fund flyer requests for all RSOs. Any additional advertising 
requests, as well as any requests by non-RSO Campus Organizations, must be 
approved by the Senate. 

\chapter{Severability}

unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible, and remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
