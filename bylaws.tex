\section{Legislation}

\subsection{Definition}
Legislation is a written proposal brought before the Senate by a Senator to take certain action or adopt, remove, or amend certain policies.

\subsection{Types}
Senators can introduce only two types of legislation to the Senate: resolutions and proclamations. A resolution can adjust fund allocations, modify governing documents of the SGA, or it can mandate action of SGA Officers. A proclamation is a decree, declaring an opinion of the Senate; it may address a specific party. Any piece of legislation that is under the consideration of the Senate shall be referred to as a bill. Any passed piece of legislation shall be referred to by its respective type: resolution or proclamation.

\section{Origin of a Bill}
A senator shall submit a bill to the Secretary, who shall place the bill on the docket. A motion to approve the bill must appear on the docket for the Senate to consider the bill. The Senate can approve only bills on the docket.

\section{Structure} \label{sec:bill_content}
\subsection{General}
A piece of legislation shall contain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a title;
    \item the proposal date
    \item the proposer(s);
    \item the sponsor(s), if any;
    \item the reasons for the legislation, in the form of a “whereas” clauses; and
    \item the intended actions, in the form of “resolved” clauses.
\end{itemize}
    

\subsection{Title}
The proposer(s) of legislation shall title their legislation in accordance to the following
structure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The type of legislation, either “Proclamation” or “Resolution”;
    \item An index code with a hyphen (“-”) separating each of the following subitems:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item “S” for Resolution and “P” for Proclamation;
        \item The last two digits of the current year — i.e. “17” for 2017 — followed by the abbreviation for the semester in which the proposer(s) presents the legislation — i.e. “S” for Spring or “F” for Fall;
        \item A three-digit ordinal number, incrementing for each bill presented to the Secretary; this number shall be prefixed with zeros to the meet three-digit requirement when necessary — i.e. “005” for the fifth bill introduced into the Senate;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The phrase “of the”, followed by the current Senate session number, followed by “Senate of the Student Government Association of Stevens Institute of Technology”;
    \item The name of the legislation, as determined by the proposer(s).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposition}
A bill must have at least one proposer. Only senators shall be proposers of a bill. The proposer(s) of a bill should only be those senators who were involved in the drafting, creating, or collaboration of the bill. A Senator may withdraw themselves as a proposer of the bill at any time until voting of approval begins on the bill. A Senator shall not be added to the list of proposers of the bill once legislation has been added to the docket. Should all proposers withdraw support of a bill The Senate may reserve the right with 2/3 majority to approve the bill with “Senate” as the proposer.

If a bill is amended prior to being passed, the proposer(s) of the bill shall be responsible for
submitting a final version of the resolution or proclamation to the Secretary for archival.

\section{Sponsorship}
A bill may have a list of sponsors. Any relevant person or entity may be listed as a sponsor of a bill. A sponsor of a bill should only be a person or entity who supports the bill, who has an intimate involvement with the bill, and who consents to sponsoring the bill. A person or entity may withdraw their sponsorship of the bill at any time until voting of approval begins on the bill. A person or entity shall not be added to the list of sponsors of the bill once the bill has been added to the docket.

These groups shall be equal or approximately equal in size and have randomly determined constituents. Each Senator shall be assigned one of these groups, hereafter referred to as “Districts”, at the beginning of each academic year. Freshmen Senators shall be assigned Districts upon taking office. If a vacancy of a Senate seat is to occur, the Senator who fills the vacancy shall be assigned the same District as the person who previously held the seat. Senators shall be responsible for regular communication with the constituents of their District and shall serve as a means of the constituents of their District sharing their concerns and opinions with the SGA as a whole. The Secretary shall be responsible for organizing and assigning Districts. The term “class year” shall be defined by the Constitution of the SGA.

\section{Elections of the Senate}

\subsection{Frequency}
Elections of the Senate shall occur once per academic year. 

\subsection{Nominations}
Nominations shall open two weeks before the constitutionally mandated election 
period and shall close one week thereafter. A prospective candidate must 
deliver a petition with signatures from 50 students within their class year to 
the Secretary in order to become nominated.

The Secretary, in conjunction with the Office of Student Life, shall then have 
one week to determine if the nominees meet the eligibility requirements to be 
a Senator as defined by Institute policy or established by resolution of the 
Senate. 

\subsection{Election}
The appropriate administrators shall be directed to enable the voting system 
immediately after the completion of the verification period. The election 
shall remain open for one week. The option to reopen nominations shall always be included in the election poll. In the event that any nominees garner less votes than the option to re-open nominations, those nominees shall not be elected in that election cycle. Of the remaining nominees, those receiving the most votes will fill the vacant seats. Any nominee who failed to be elected shall still have the ability to run in future elections. The elected Senators shall assume office at the beginning of the next meeting of the Senate.

\subsection{Vacancy}
In the circumstance of a vacancy of a Senate seat or receipt by the Secretary of a
Senator’s resignation, a vacancy election shall be held. Once the Election
Committee recognizes the need for a vacancy election, the nomination period must
begin within five days. This period after the acknowledgment of the resignation or
vacancy and before the nomination period begins shall be used by the Public
Relations Committee to prepare a publicity campaign, by the Secretary to contact
the appropriate administrators to set up a vacancy election, and by the Election
Committee to determine the election timeline and announce it to the Senate who
shall announce it to the Student Body. The nomination period will last for an
amount of time determined by the Election Committee of no less than three days
and no more than four days. There shall be a verification period immediately following the nomination period which shall last for an amount of time determined

last for three days, immediately following the closure of the verification period.
The results must be certified by the verification procedure outlined in Section
7.3(E). Elected Senators shall assume office once verified by the Election
Committee. If the preliminary vacancy election procedure ends with Senate seats left vacant,
the vacancy election procedure shall recommence. These subsequent vacancy
elections periods shall begin no more than three days following the end of the the
previous vacancy election period. The Senate seats after the third
repetition of vacancy elections shall be closed unless reopened by the Senate by a simple majority vote. Members of the Student Body shall have one vote

procedure shall commence once the Senate is in session.

\section{Senate Resignations}
In order to resign, a Senator must submit a formal resignation to the Secretary and
Speaker in written notice. By submitting a formal resignation, a Senator immediately forfeits their Senate seat and shall not be able to resume their position

The Secretary shall prepare an agenda (or “docket”) for each regular meeting, showing the time
and place and the business items to be discussed, provided that it adheres to the order of
business set forth in these bylaws. The Secretary shall provide a copy of the agenda to all
Officials of the SGA at least 72 hours before the meeting. For items to be placed on the agenda,
an Official of the SGA must submit their bills, communications, memos, discussion items, or any
other matters to the Secretary by written notice before the submission deadline. All submissions
must be included in the agenda.

\subsection{Submission Deadline}
The submission deadline shall be 11:59 PM local time on Wednesday preceding the regular meeting.
However, if the Secretary receives a submission after the deadline has passed, the Secretary
shall have the power to decide whether or not the submission will be added to the agenda. If the
Secretary adds anything to the agenda after already providing a copy of the agenda to each
Official of the SGA, the Secretary must provide an updated agenda for each Official of the SGA,
notifying them that it has been updated. The Secretary may not add any new items to the
agenda if the start of the meeting will occur within 24 hours.

\subsection{Quorum}
Two-thirds of all Senators shall constitute quorum. Quorum must exist for motions to be
adopted. If, at any time during a meeting, a Senator raises a question as to the presence of quorum, the
Speaker shall forthwith direct the Secretary to count the number of Senators present and shall
announce the result, and these proceedings shall be without debate.
\subsection{Speaker}
The chair of all meetings of the Senate shall be the Speaker, unless otherwise described by
these bylaws. The Speaker shall be elected to a term coinciding with the current session of the
Senate. The Speaker shall be elected during the Senate’s first meeting of a new Session. The
first order of business during this meeting shall be to elect a Speaker. Until the Speaker is
elected, the Vice President of Operations shall be acting Speaker at this meeting. Once a
motion to elect a Speaker has been entertained, the Vice-President of Operations shall accept
nominations from the floor. Only Senators may nominate a Speaker, and each nomination must
be seconded by another Senator. The winning nominee shall, in a vote by secret ballot,
accumulate a plurality of the votes of the Senators present.

If the Speaker resigns, the Senate must hold a vacancy election for a Speaker at the next
general meeting. Until a new Speaker is elected, the Speaker pro-tempore shall be acting
Speaker of meetings. For the vacancy election, only Senators may nominate a Speaker, and
each nomination must be seconded by another Senator. The winning nominee of the vacancy
election shall, in a vote by secret ballot, accumulate a plurality of the votes of the Senators
present. Upon completion of the vacancy election, the Speaker pro-tempore shall no longer hold
the Speaker pro-tempore position, and the new Speaker must appoint a new Speaker
pro-tempore.

\subsection{Speaker Pro-tempore}
If the Speaker cannot preside over a Senate meeting, the duty shall fall to the Speaker
pro-tempore only until the Speaker can preside over the Senate. The Speaker pro-tempore shall
be appointed by the Speaker at the first meeting of a new Session of the Senate, and the
appointment does not have to be approved by the Senate. The term for this position coincides
with a Session of the Senate. The Speaker pro-tempore must be a Senator. 

If the Speaker
pro-tempore resigns from this position before the end of the term, then the Speaker must
appoint a new Speaker pro-tempore at the next meeting.
If the Speaker and Speaker pro-tempore cannot preside over the Senate meeting, the duty shall
fall to the Vice-President of Operations.

\subsection{Secretary Pro-tempore}
If the Secretary is unable to attend all or part of a Senate meeting, the Secretary pro-tempore
from the Senate will fill in to take the minutes for the meeting, or until the Secretary returns. The
Secretary pro-tempore shall be appointed by the Secretary, and the appointment does not have
to be approved by the Senate. The term for this position coincides with a Session of the Senate.
The Secretary pro-tempore must be a Senator. If the Secretary pro-tempore resigns from this
position before the end of the term, then the Secretary must appoint a new Secretary
pro-tempore at the next meeting.

If the Secretary and Secretary pro-tempore are unable to attend all or part of the meeting, the
duty shall fall to the Vice-President of Operations.

\subsection{Order of Business}
All business of the Senate shall be taken up for consideration and disposed in the following
order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Call to Order
    \item Public Forum
    \item Approval of Minutes
    \item Report from the Speaker
    \item Reports on Standing Committee
    \item Reports on Ad Hoc Committee
    \item Report on Entertainment Committee
    \item Reports on Committee on Student Interests Subcommittees
    \item Reports from Executive Branch Officials
    \item Read Bills
    \item Unread Bills
    \item Other business submitted to the Secretary
    \item New Business
    \item Adjournment 
\end{enumerate}
Senators shall have the authority to deviate from the order of business as necessary for the
efficient conduct of the meeting. However, the Speaker, at their discretion, may refuse to
entertain motions that deviate from the order of business, provided that the Senate may override
the Speaker’s decision by a majority vote.

\subsection{Reading Period}
Every resolution  shall be subjected to one reading before it may be approved. All
proclamations placed on the docket by the Secretary are considered read. The approval of a resolution shall not occur in the same meeting as the first reading.
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item First Reading 
\end{enumerate}
The first reading is when a resolution is introduced to the Senate. The first reading shall occur by adopting a motion to read a resolution. The motion to read a resolution shall be stated as “I move to read
[“resolution”].” The motion to read a resolution shall have the following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It requires a second.
    \item It shall not be amendable.
    \item It shall be debatable. Debate shall last no longer than five minutes, provided, however,
that debate may end sooner at the discretion of two-thirds of the Senate. Debate may
not be extended.
    \item Adoption of this motion shall not require a vote; instead, adoption of this motion shall
occur upon closure of debate.
    \item It shall not be reconsidered.
\end{enumerate}
Upon adoption of the motion to read a resolution, (a) the resolution is considered read, and (b) the Secretary
shall place a motion to approve the resolution on the agenda for the following meeting of the Senate.

\subsection{Obtaining the Floor and Debate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rights of the Speaker

If the Speaker is a Senator, the Speaker may move or second even while presiding over the
meeting. If the Speaker is not a Senator, the Speaker may not move, second, nor vote.
    \item Rights of the Non-Senators
    
Non-Senators may participate in debate, only when called upon by the Speaker. The Speaker
must prioritize debate of Senators over non-Senators, provided, however, the Speaker may
choose to call on non-Senators over Senators as necessary for the efficient conduct of the
meeting. Non-Senators may not move, second, nor vote.
    \item Privilege of Opening Debate
    
When a Senator makes a motion, that Senator shall, at their discretion, have the privilege of
opening debate. The Speaker must call on that Senator once debate begins on a debatable
motion.

However, when a Senator moves to approve a bill that they did not propose, that Senator shall
not open debate; instead, a proposer of the bill shall, at their discretion, have the privilege of
opening debate. The Speaker must call on a proposer of the bill once debate begins on the
motion to approve the bill.
    \item The Five Minute Rule
    
The Speaker shall have the power to close debate for any debatable motion and bring the
Senate to a vote for the immediate question, provided, however, that the Senate shall be
allowed a minimum of five minutes to debate for any debatable motion. The Senate may appeal
the Speaker’s decision by majority vote.


The Senate may choose to end debate before that five minute period is over by adopting a
motion to previous question. However, the motion to previous question shall not be adopted if
both (a) five minutes have not passed since debate began, and (b) at least one person votes
against the adoption of the motion to previous question.
    \item Informality 

Any person, having obtained the floor, does not (a) have to begin speaking by addressing the
Speaker, nor (b) have to avoid personal references. However, any person, having obtained the
floor, must avoid indecorous language.
    \item Maximum Time for Each Speech
    
Any person, having obtained the floor while a debatable motion is immediately pending, shall
speak no longer than ten minutes unless obtaining permission from the Senate. Such
permission can be given by unanimous consent, or by means of a motion to extend the limits of
debate, which requires a two-thirds vote without debate.
    \item Number of Speeches on the Same Question Per Member Per Day

Any person may speak unlimited times for the same question on the same day — except that in
the case of a motion to appeal, only the Speaker can speak twice (the second time at the close
of debate).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{One Third Abstention}
Should more than one-third of the senators present abstain on a vote of a debatable motion, the
Senate shall not adopt that motion.
\subsection{Minutes}
The Secretary shall record minutes of all regular and emergency meetings of the Senate
showing the time and place; Officials of the SGA present and any non-Official of the SGA
present, provided that they speak at least once during the meeting; Officials of the SGA absent
and excused; Officials of the SGA absent and unexcused; Officials of the SGA either early or
late; all motions made; the results of every vote including the number of yeas, nays, and
abstains, provided that the vote was not taken by voice; the vote of each member for every
motion, provided that the vote was not taken by voice and was non-secret.

The Secretary must also include transcriptions of all discussion at every meeting of the Senate
in the minutes; however, it does not have to be a verbatim record.

Lack of minutes for a particular meeting or part of a meeting will void any action not recorded,
provided that there was no bad faith involved.

\subsection{Censure}
The Senate may vote to censure a Senator if the Senate deems that the Senator is speaking irresponsibly. A vote of seventy-five percent of the Senate is required. 

Should a Senator be censured, they will surrender their right to speak until the business item has been resolved. They shall not lose their right to vote on the business item. 

\section{Sessions of the Senate} \label{sec:senate_sessions}

\subsection{Definition}
The session of a particular Senate shall begin at the start of the Senate 
meeting following the conclusion of Senate elections, and end at the start of 
the next session of the Senate. A session of the Senate is separate from the
parliamentary session, which shall remain defined as the default as adopted
from the Senate’s parliamentary authority.

\subsection{Senate Number}
Each session of the Senate shall be numbered, beginning with the first session 
of the Student Council in April 1913. The Senate of the 2012-2013 school year

consider a resolution to come back from recess ahead of schedule. 

\subsection{Reduced Session}

the Senate and approval of the President. No standing motion shall be 
inconsistent with or supersede the bylaws or Constitution of the SGA. Standing 
motions shall only have effect until the close of the current session of the 
Senate. No standing motion shall be construed to grant additional powers to 
recognized organizations or the SGA. 

\section{Financial Powers}
The Senate shall have the power to transfer money between SGA accounts and 
Campus Organization accounts. The Senate may not transfer money out of the 
Discretionary Fund held by the Cabinet. The Senate shall have the power to

Unified Elections, and until their successor is elected, or a lesser
term if specified in the RSO’s Constitution. Officers of an RSO will
take office immediately following their election, unless otherwise
specified in the RSO’s Constitution.

\paragraph{Timeline}
Unified Elections shall occur once every academic year. The first full
week of school following the University-defined Spring Recess shall be
the Unified Elections period. The last week of school preceding Spring
Recess shall be the Unified Nominations period. An RSO must accept
officer nominations during the Unified Nominations period, submit all
nominations to the Office of Student Life immediately thereafter, and
then hold a special meeting for elections of all officers during the
Unified Elections period, in which any ballot cast for an individual
whose nomination was not previously approved by the Office of Student
Life will be considered invalid.

\paragraph{Custom Elections}
An RSO may define in their Constitution a custom period for their
Unified Elections, provided there is at least one week in between the
Unified Nominations period and the Unified Elections period, and that
the elections process complies with all other rules specified in these
bylaws, especially above.

\paragraph{Changes}

must be appointed by a majority, or higher if specified by the RSO by

\section{Overruling of Quorum or Voting Membership}
Should an RSO become unable to conduct business due to its inability to achieve quorum or the necessary amount of eligible voting members at any of its meetings as a result of an ineffective definition of quorum or voting membership in its constitution or bylaws, the RSO’s quorum or definition of voting membership may be temporarily overruled by the Vice President of Student Interests. The Vice President of Student Interests shall mandate a more suitable, temporary definition of quorum or voting membership for the RSO that allows for business to be conducted at its meetings. This temporary definition of quorum or voting membership shall only last until the RSO has voted on the business it initially sought to conduct, amended its definition of quorum or voting membership in its constitution or bylaws to be more suitable, and had any changes to its constitution reviewed by the Rules Committee and approved by the Senate. This process shall not occur unless the RSO submits evidence to the Vice President of Student Interests of having held at least one special meeting designated solely for the purpose of conducting business and having notified the entirety of its voting membership of this meeting at least one week prior.

\section {Organizational Oversight}
The Committee on Student Interests shall ensure that organizations are complying with all rules applicable to the respective organizations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remove a certain person from an organization's executive board
    \item Remove certain people from the organization’s executive board

    \item Withhold all of an organization’s finances for the remainder of the semester 
    \item Dissolve the organization
\end{enumerate}
If a majority of members determine that the concern is a minor concern, then a majority of the Committee must recommend one of the following punishments:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preclude the organization from the publicity committee, which allows organizations to freely print posters, for the remainder of the semester
    \item Withhold some of the organization’s finances for the remainder of the semester, an amount determined by the Committee

Once a punishment is decided by the Committee, the Vice President of Student Interests must submit to the Secretary the recommendation by the Committee. The Secretary must place there commendation on the agenda, even if the submission deadline has passed

At a Senate meeting, the Senate may consider the recommendation by the Committee. With a majority vote, the Senate may modify the recommendation by the Committee. A majority of Senators must approve the recommendation by the Committee for it to be enacted.
